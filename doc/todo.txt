- fix  *(end+4)='\0'; in mongoose.c on_recv_data
- error handling
- curl tests: check how logs are collected when multiple queries in one test, with some of them repeated
- extract curl and dns tests to their own files, and make them independent
- integrate tracebox
- mptcp in userspace http://fr.slideshare.net/mobile/hajimetazaki/library-operating-system-for-linux-netdev01 http://www.catonmat.net/blog/simple-ld-preload-tutorial/
- refactor query_info to have only one query_info type, which can be passed eg to upload_log so it can determine if the log should be uploaded based on test result
- how do we react when a test fails, eg transfer hangs?
- check security of values taken by the server from the headers to build the log paths [PARTIAL]
- define dns tests: what to resolve, what to check? (ips might change with location, eg yahoo, google)
- create web interface to present result to users? Enter full run id, and get access to logs and results? Privacy problems?
- check c-ares ipv6 resolution of mptcp.org


- add control of headers in server code sending 404 [DONE]
- generate control headers with 404 response [DONE]
- compare actual to expected values, and control headers values [DONE]
- collect the payload_specs of the subsequent repetition of a query in a linked list [DONE]
- collect data of the run on client and server. Add log function [DONE]
- write headers and body of query repetitions in distinct files? [DONE]
- add collection of what is sent to server. Currently only received data is collected [DONE]
- rename output_file to output_dir and move it to the root of the config file (same value for all tests) [DONE]
- support non curl tests in config file [DONE]
- upload client logs [DONE]
- do not crash when query empty.... at *(end+4)='\0'; [DONE]
- do not crash when headers needed for log path are not there server.c:161 (build_log_path) [DONE]
- disable mptcp for upload of logs and download of tests config [DONE]
- repeat tests with/without mptcp, with/without mptcp csum [DONE]
- put client user output in file to be uploaded too [DONE]
- check that port are different when run with "Connection: Close" header [DONE]
