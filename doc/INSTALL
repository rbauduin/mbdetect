I use GNU stow to manage source installs

requires libconfig-dev

requires libsodium
------------------

./configure --prefix=/usr/local/stow/libsodium-1.0.2
make
make install
cd /usr/local/stow
sudo stow libsodium-1.0.2


file utils/mbd_version.h is generated by the makefile, and included by both client and server.
